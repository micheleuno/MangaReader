# MangaReader
I have no idea what i'm doing but whatever (i doubt anyone will read this)
This is an UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application that lets you add a manga or comic (previously downloaded with 
something like Free Manga Downloader) and read it comfortably in your PC or windows-based tablet.

What to expect:  
-Add multiple Mangas.  
-Set a root folder and add every new manga pressing a button
-Continue from previously read episode and page.    
-Fullscreen mode.  
-Change reading direction (Left to Right, Right to Left or Top to Bottom).  
-Fit image to Width or Heigth  
-Double click to zoom in and out.  
-Some reading statistics (Number of pages, episodes and mangas finished, and time spent reading).  
-Almost nice UI.  
-Decent performance even on Atom-Based devices.  
-Probable Bug and crashes.     
-Kinda excesive ram usage (Fixed).      
-Some stutter in larger images.  

What not to expect:  
-Tidy, commented and efficient code.  

Disclaimers:  
This is my first ever apliccation in C# and Visual Studio.  
I'm not a native english speaker.
